#  Water Resources Allocation Model
## Description
Water Resources Allocation (WRA) model is an integrated surface water-groundwater model that can internally and explicitly simulate irrigation water supplies and hydrological impacts of water management policies with high spatial and temporal resolutions. The WRA is based on GSFLOW model.

## Features

* Automatically simulte conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water for agriculture use
* Requires limited information to perform historical and future simulations, and the information can be easily derived from geospatial data and statistical reports.
* Allows to simulate canal processes including canal evaporation and seepage, which are usually ignored in many existing models.
* Provides a flexible structure through which different water management policies can be simulated.

## Executing the model
The WRA model can be run by using the Visual HEIFLOW (VHF) software. VHF provides an integrated environment for running HEIFLOW and GSFLOW models. The latest setup file of VHF can be downloaded via the link: https://github.com/DeepHydro/Visual-HEIFLOW/releases/tag/1.0.3. The instruction on installing the VHF could be found at https://github.com/DeepHydro/Visual-HEIFLOW

## Example
A sample problem with WRA data sets is provided in the "data" subdirectory. The example model can be opened and run using the Visual Heiflow (VHF) software.
