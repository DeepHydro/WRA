#  Water Resources Allocation Model
## Description
Water Resources Allocation (WRA) model is an integrated surface water-groundwater model that can internally and explicitly simulate irrigation water supplies and hydrological impacts of water management policies with high spatial and temporal resolutions. 

## Features
* Streamlines the entire integrated modeling procedure, from data preparation at the very beginning to visualization and analysis of modeling results, in a uniform environment.
* Provides complete access to the relational database, as well as mapping, and 3D visualization tools to support the model development process. It allow users to take advantage of all types of GIS data available for hydrologic modeling.
* Uses a generic multivariable-space-time data cube model, which enables the system to efficiently handle large
time-series datasets over a large spatial domain. 
* Allows updating the land use input at user-specified time points without manual interruption and therefore enables the model to directly simulate the hydrological effects of changing land use.
