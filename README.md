#  Water Resources Allocation Model
## Description
Water Resources Allocation (WRA) model is an integrated surface water-groundwater model that can internally and explicitly simulate irrigation water supplies and hydrological impacts of water management policies with high spatial and temporal resolutions. 

## Features

* Requires limited information to perform historical and future simulations, and the information can be easily derived from geospatial data and statistical reports.
* Allows to simulate canal processes including canal evaporation and seepage, which are usually ignored in many existing models.
* Provides a flexible structure through which different water management policies can be simulated.

## Executing the model
A 64-bit executable file is provided in the "bin" subdirectory and can be directly run on WINDOWS operation system.

## Testing
A sample problem with WRA data sets is provided in the "data" subdirectory to verify that WRA is correctly installed and running on the user's system.The sample problems also may be looked at as examples of how to use the program.
